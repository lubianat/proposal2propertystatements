====Motivation====
When it comes to structured information about mathematical functions, {{Q|Q24534}} is a reference work that is widely used both within and beyond the Wikimedia ecosystem. Mapping to it in a systematic fashion by way of such a property would help improve Wikidata's coverage of functions too.

* {{s}} external identifier. I would also suggest properties like [[Property:P829|OEIS ID]] for people looking for other similar properties (external identifiers). [[User:Jsamwrites|John Samuel]] ([[User:Jsamwrites|talk]]) 07:58, 30 December 2022 (UTC)
* {{s}} Nice. [[User:ArthurPSmith|ArthurPSmith]] ([[User talk:ArthurPSmith|<span class="signature-talk">{{int:Talkpagelinktext}}</span>]]) 15:21, 31 December 2022 (UTC)

* {{s}} To discover the link to a formula one can hover over the circled "i" and look for "permalink" (Stating it here because I needed a moment to find this.). Looks like a great source.
